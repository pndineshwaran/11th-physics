# Measurement Of Time Intervals
---
_“Time flows uniformly forward” – Sir Issac Newton_

_“Time is what a clock reads” – Albert Einstein_

---
A clock is used to measure the time interval. An atomic standard of time, is based on the periodic vibration produced in a Cesium atom. Some of the clocks developed later are electric oscillators, electronic oscillators, solar clock, quartz crystal clock, atomic clock, decay of elementary particles, radioactive dating etc. The order of time intervals are tabulated in Table 1.7.

**Figure 1.8 The atomic clock, which** keeps time on the basis of radiation from cesium atoms is accurate to about three millionths of a second per year.
