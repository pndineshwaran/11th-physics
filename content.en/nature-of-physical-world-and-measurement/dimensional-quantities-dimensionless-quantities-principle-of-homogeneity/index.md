# Dimensional Quantities, Dimensionless Quantities, Principle of Homogeneity


On the basis of dimension, we can classify quantities into four categories.

**(1)Dimensional variables** 

Physical quantities, which possess dimensions and have variable values are called dimensional variables. Examples are length, velocity, and acceleration etc.

**(2) Dimensionless variables** 

Physical quantities which have no dimensions, but have variable values are called dimensionless variables. Examples are specific gravity, strain, refractive index etc.

**(3) Dimensional Constant** 

Physical quantities which possess dimensions and have constant values are called dimensional constants. Examples are Gravitational constant, Planck’s constant etc.

**(4) Dimensionless Constant** 

Quantities which have constant values and also have no dimensions are called dimensionless constants. Examples are π, e (Euler’s number), numbers etc.

**Principle of homogeneity of dimensions** 

The principle of homogeneity of dimensions states that the dimensions of all the terms in a physical expression should be the same. For example, in the physical expression \\(v^2\\) = \\(u^2\\) + 2as, the dimensions of \\(v^2\\), \\(u^2\\) and 2 as are the same and equal to [\\(L^2T^{−2}\\)].
