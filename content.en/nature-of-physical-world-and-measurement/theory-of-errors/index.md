# Theory Of Errors

The foundation of all experimental science and technology is measurement. The result obtained from any measurement will contain some uncertainty. Such an uncertainty is termed **_error_**_._ Any calculation made using the measured values will also have an error. It is not possible to make exact measurements in an experiment. In measurements, two different terms, accuracy and precision are used and need  to be distinguished at this stage. Accuracy refers to how far we are from the true value, and precision refers to how well we measure.
