# Arithmetical Operations with Significant Figures


**(i) Addition and subtraction** In addition and subtraction, the final

result should retain as many decimal places as there are in the number with the smallest number of decimal places.

**Example:**

1\. 3.1 + 1.780 + 2.046 = 6.926 

Here the least number of significant digits after the decimal is one. Hence the result will be 6.9.

2\. 12.637 – 2.42 = 10.217 

Here the least number of significant digits after the decimal is two. Hence the result will be 10.22

**(ii) Multiplication and Division** In multiplication or division, the final result should retain as many significant figures as there are in the original number with smallest number of significant figures.

**Example:** 

1\. 1.21 × 36.72 = 44.4312 = 44.4

Here the least number of significant digits in the measured values is three. Hence the result when rounded off to three significant digits is 44.4

2\. 36.72 ÷ 1.2 = 30.6 = 31 

Here the least number of significant digits in the measured values is two. Hence the result when rounded off to significant digit becomes 31.
