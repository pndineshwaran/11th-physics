# Measurement of mass

Mass is a property of matter. It does not depend on temperature, pressure and location of the body in space. _Mass of a body is defined as the quantity of matter contained in a body. The SI unit of mass is kilogram_ (kg). The masses of objects which we shall study in this course vary over a wide range. These may vary from a tiny mass of electron (9.11×10−31kg) to the huge mass of the known universe (=1055 kg). The order of masses of various objects is shown in Table 1.6.

Ordinarily, the mass of an object is determined in kilograms using a common balance like the one used in a grocery shop. For measuring larger masses like

**Table 1.6** Range of masses 
|**Object**|**Order of mass (kg)**|
|---|----|
|Electron | \\(10^{-30}\\)|
|Proton or Neutron | \\(10^{-27}\\) |
|Uranium atom | \\(10^{-25}\\)|
|Red blood corpuscle | \\(10^{-14}\\) |
|A cell | \\(10^{-10}\\)|
|Dust particle | \\(10^{-9}\\)|
|Raindrop | \\(10^{-6}\\) |
|Mosquito | \\(10^{-5}\\) |
|Grape | \\(10^{-3}\\) |
|Frog | \\(10^{-1}\\) |
|Human | \\(10^{2}\\)|
|Car | \\(10^{3}\\)|
|Ship | \\(10^{5}\\)|
|Moon |\\(10^{23}\\)|
|Earth | \\(10^{25}\\)|
|Sun | \\(10^{30}\\)|
|Milky way | \\(10^{41}\\)|
|Observable Universe | \\(10^{55}\\)|  

that of planets, stars etc., we make use of gravitational methods. For measurement of small masses of atomic/subatomic particles etc., we make use of a mass spectrograph.

Some of the weighing balances commonly used are common balance, spring balance, electronic balance, etc.
