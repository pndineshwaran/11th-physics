# SUMMARY

 Aristotle’s idea of motion: To maintain motion, a force is required

 Galileo’s idea of motion: To maintain motion, a force is not required

 Mass is a measure of inertia of the body

 Newton’s first law states that under no external force, the object continues its state of 
motion or state of rest.

 Newton’s second law states that to change the momentum of the body, external force 
is required
Mathematically it is defined as  
F =dp/dt 

 Both Newton’s first and second laws are valid only in inertial frames

 Inertial frame is the one in which if there is no force on the object, the object moves 
at constant velocity.

 Newton’s third law states that for every force there is an equivalent and opposite 
force and such a pair of forces is called action and reaction pair.

 To draw a free body diagram for an object, 

    	Isolate the object from other objects and identify the forces acting on it
    	The force exerted by that object should not be taken into account
    	Draw the direction of each force with relative magnitude
    	Apply Newton’s second law in each direction
 If no net external force acts on a collection of particles (system), then the total 
momentum of the collection of particles (system) is a constant vector.

 Internal forces acting in the system cannot change the total momentum of the system.

 Lami’s theorem states that if an object is in equilibrium under the concurrent forces, 
then the ratio of each force with the sine of corresponding opposite angle is same.

 An impulse acting on a body is equal to the change in momentum of the body. 
Whenever a force acts on the object for a very short time, it is difficult to calculate 
the force. But impulse can be calculated.

 Static friction is the force which always opposes the movement of the object from 
rest. It can take values from zero to ms
N. If an external force is greater than ms
N then 
object begins to move.

 If the object begins to move, kinetic friction comes into effect. To move an object 
with constant velocity, the external force must be applied to overcome the kinetic 
friction. The kinetic friction is mk
N. 

 Rolling friction is much smaller than static and kinetic friction. This is the reason 
that to move an object roller coaster is fixed in the bottom of the object. Example: 
Rolling suitcase

# SUMMARY(cont)

 The origin of friction is electromagnetic interaction between the atoms of two 
surfaces which are touching each other.

 Whenever there is a motion along a curve, there must be a centripetal force that acts 
towards the centre of the curve. In uniform circular motion the centripetal force acts 
at the centre of the circle. 

 The centripetal force is not a separate natural force. Any natural force can behave 
as centripetal force. In planetary motion, Sun’s gravitational force acts as centripetal 
force. In the whirling motion of a stone attached to a string, the centripetal force is 
given by the string. When Moon orbits the Earth, it experiences Earth’s gravitational 
force as centripetal force.

 Centrifugal force arises whenever the motion is analysed from rotating frame. It is 
a pseudo force. The inertial motion of the object appears as centrifugal force in the 
rotating frame.

 The magnitude of centrifugal and centripetal force is m r ω2 . But centripetal force 
acts towards centre of the circular motion and centrifugal force appears to acts in 
the opposite direction to centripetal force.
