STEPS:

• Use the URL or scan the QR code to open interactive simulation on ‘Pressure and Volume 
Diagram ”. 
• At selected temperature, change the “Volume” given below the graph and click play button.
• Now select a different temperature, change the ‘Volume’ again and find the change in the 
pressure both in the left image and graph.
• Repeat the same with different values and try drawing the graph accordingly. This also 
helps to understand isothermal process.

At selected temperature, change the “Volume” given below the graph and click play button.
