doll do when disturbed? It will dance such that the head and body move continuously in a to and fro motion, until the movement gradually stops. Similarly, when we walk on the road, our hands and legs will move front and back. Again similarly, when a mother swings a cradle to make her child sleep, the cradle is made to move in to and fro motion. All these motions are different from the motion that we have discussed so far. These motions are shown in Figure 10.2. Generally, they are known as oscillatory motion or vibratory motion. A similar motion occurs even at atomic levels.

When the temperature is raised, the atoms in a solid vibrate about their mean position or equilibrium position. The study of vibrational motion is very important in engineering applications, such as, designing the structure of building, mechanical equipments, etc.
## Periodic and non- periodic motion
Motion in physics can be classified as repetitive (periodic motion) and non- repetitive (non-periodic motion).

1. Periodic motion** Any motion which repeats itself in a fixed time interval is known as periodic motion. Examples : Hands in pendulum clock, swing of a cradle, the revolution of the Earth around the Sun, waxing and waning of Moon, etc.

2. Non-Periodic motion** Any motion which does not repeat itself after a regular interval of time is known as non-periodic motion. **Example :** Occurance of Earth quake, eruption of volcano, etc.

**EXAMPLE 10.1**

Classify the following motions as periodic and non-periodic motions?. a. Motion of Halley’s comet. b. Motion of clouds. c. Moon revolving around the Earth.

**Solution**

a. Periodic motion

**Figure 10.2.** Oscillatory or vibratory motions  

b. Non-periodic motion c. Periodic motion

**EXAMPLE 10.2**

Which of the following functions of time represent periodic and non-periodic motion?. a. sin _ωt +_ cos _ωt_ b. ln _ωt_

**Solution**

a. Periodic b. Non-periodic

**Question to ponder**

Discuss “what will happen if the motion of the Earth around the Sun is not a periodic motion”.

## Oscillatory motion
_When an object or a particle moves back and forth repeatedly for some duration of time its motion is said to be oscillatory (or vibratory)_. Examples; our heart beat, swinging motion of the wings of an insect, grandfather’s clock (pendulum clock), etc. Note that all oscillatory motion are periodic whereas all periodic motions need not be oscillation in nature. see Figure 10.3

# SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION (SHM)
**Figure 10.4** Simple Harmonic Motion

Equilibrium position

A simple harmonic motion is a special type of oscillatory motion. But all oscillatory motions need not be simple harmonic .

**Note**  

Simple harmonic motion is a special type of oscillatory motion in which the acceleration or force on the particle is directly proportional to its displacement from a fixed point and is always directed towards that fixed point. In one dimensional case, let _x_ be the displacement of the particle and _ax_ be the acceleration of the particle, then

_ax_ ∝ _x_ (10.1)

_ax_ \= − b _x_ (10.2)

where _b_ is a constant which measures acceleration per unit displacement and dimensionally it is equal to _T_ −2. By multiplying by mass of the particle on both sides of equation (10.2) and from Newton’s second law, the force is

_Fx_\= _−_ _k_ _x_ (10.3)

where k is a force constant which is defined as force per unit length. The negative sign indicates that displacement and force (or acceleration) are in opposite directions. This means that when the displacement of the particle is taken towards right of equilibrium position (_x_ takes positive value), the force (or acceleration) will point towards equilibrium (towards left) and similarly, when the

**s**
displacement of the particle is taken towards left of equilibrium position (x takes negative value), the force (or acceleration) will point towards equilibrium (towards right). This type of force is known as restoring **_force_** _because it always directs the particle executing simple harmonic motion to restore to its original (equilibrium or mean) position_. This force (restoring force) is central and attractive whose center of attraction is the equilibrium position.

In order to represent in two or three dimensions, we can write using vector notation



_F k r_  (10.4)

where _r_ is the displacement of the particle from the chosen origin. Note that the force and displacement have a linear relationship. This means that the exponent of force



_F_ and the exponent of displacement _r_ are unity. The sketch between cause (magnitude of force | 

_F_ |) and effect (magnitude of displacement | _r_ |) is a straight line passing through second and fourth quadrant as shown in

## The projection of uniform circular motion on a diameter of SHM
Consider a particle of mass _m_ moving with uniform speed _v_ along the circumference of a circle whose radius is _r_ in anti-clockwise direction (as shown in Figure 10.6). Let us assume that the origin of the coordinate system coincides with the center _O_ of the circle. If _ω_ is the angular velocity of the particle and _θ_ the angular displacement of the particle at any instant of time _t_, then _θ_ = _ωt_. By projecting the uniform circular motion on its diameter gives a simple harmonic motion. This means that we can associate

As a specific example, consider a spring mass system (or oscillation of pendulum) as shown in Figure 10.8. When the spring moves up and down (or pendulum moves to and fro), the motion of the mass or bob is mapped to points on the circular motion.

**Figure 10.8** Motion of spring mass (or simple pendulum) related to uniform circular motion

Thus, if a particle undergoes uniform circular motion then the projection of the particle on the diameter of the circle (or on a line parallel to the diameter ) traces straightline motion which is simple harmonic in nature. The circle is known as reference circle of the simple harmonic motion. _The simple harmonic motion can also be defined as the motion of the projection of a particle on any diameter of a circle of reference._

_The distance travelled by the vibrating particle at any instant of time t from its mean position is known as displacement._

Let _P_ be the position of the particle on a circle of radius A at some instant of time _t_ as shown in Figure 10.9. Then its displacement y at that instant of time _t_ can be derived as follows In ∆_OPN_

sin sinθ θ= ⇒ = _ON OP_

_ON OP_ (10.5)

But θ = _ωt_, ON = _y_ and OP = _A_

| Figure 10.9 Displacement, velocity and acceleration of a particle at some instant of time |
  

_y_ = _A_ sin ω_t_ (10.6)

The displacement y takes maximum value (which is equal to A) when sin ωt = 1. This _maximum displacement from the mean position is known as amplitude (A) of the vibrating particle._ For simple harmonic motion, the amplitude is constant. But, in general, for any motion other than simple harmonic, the amplitude need not be constant, it may vary with time.

**Velocity** The rate of change of displacement is velocity. Taking derivative of equation (10.6) with respect to time, we get

_v dy dt_

_d dt_

\= = (A sin _ωt_)

For circular motion (of constant radius), amplitude _A_ is a constant and further, for uniform circular motion, angular velocity _ω is a constant. Therefore,_

_v dy dt_

\= = A ω cos ω_t_ (10.7)

Using trigonometry identity, sin2 _ωt_ \+ cos2 _ωt_ \=1 ⇒ cos _ωt_ \= 1 2-sin ω_t_ we get _v A t_\= −ω ω1 2sin

From equation (10.8), when the displacement _y_ = 0, the velocity _v_ = _ωA_ (maximum) and for the maximum displacement _y_ = A, the velocity _v_ = 0 (minimum). As displacement increases from zero to maximum, the velocity decreases from maximum to zero. This is repeated. Since velocity is a vector quantity, equation (10.7) can also be deduced by resolving in to components.

**Acceleration** The rate of change of velocity is acceleration. Taking derivative of equation 10.7 with respect to time,

_a dv dt_

(_y_ \= 0), velocity of the particle is maximum but the acceleration of the particle is zero. At the extreme position (_y_ = ±_A_), the velocity of the particle is zero but the acceleration is maximum _Aω_2 acting in the opposite direction.

Which of the following represent simple harmonic motion? (i) _x_ = _A_ sin ω_t_ \+ B cos _ωt_ (ii) _x_ = _A_ sin ωt+ B cos 2_ωt_ (iii) _x_ = _A_ _e_iωt

(iv) _x_ = _A_ ln _ωt_

## Time period, frequency, phase, phase difference and epoch in SHM.
(i) **Time period** The time period is defined as the time taken by a particle to complete one oscillation. It is usually denoted by _T_. For one complete revolution, the time taken is _t_ = T, therefore

ω_T_ \= 2π ⇒_T_ \= 2π ω

(10.11)

Then, the displacement of a particle executing simple harmonic motion can be written either as sine function or cosine function.

_y_(_t_)= _A_ sin 2π _T_

_t_ or _y_(_t_) = _A_ cos 2π _T_

_t_

where _T_ represents the time period. Suppose the time _t_ is replaced by _t_ + _T_, then the function  

)

_y_(_t_ \+ _T_) = A sin 2π _T_

(_t_ \+ _T_)

\= _A_ sin( 2π _T_

_t_ \+ 2π)

\= _A_ sin 2π _T_

_t_ = _y_(_t_)

_y_(_t_ \+ _T_) = _y_(_t_) Thus, the function repeats after one time period. This y(t) is an example of periodic function.

(ii) **Frequency and angular frequency** The number of oscillations produced by the particle per second is called frequency. It is denoted by _f_. SI unit for frequency is _s_−1 or hertz (In symbol, Hz). Mathematically, frequency is related to time period by

_f T_

\= 1 (10.12)

The number of cycles (or revolutions) per second is called angular frequency. It is usually denoted by the Greek small letter ‘omega’, ω. Comparing equation (10.11) and equation (10.12), angular frequency and frequency are related by

ω = 2_πf_ (10.13)

SI unit for angular frequency is rad _s_−1. (read it as radian per second)

(iii) **Phase** The phase of a vibrating particle at any instant completely specifies the state of the particle. It expresses the position and direction of motion of the particle at that instant with respect to its mean position (Figure 10.11).

_y_ \= _A_ sin (ω_t_ \+ φ0) (10.14)

where ω_t_ \+ φ0 = φ _is called the phase of the vibrating particle. At time t_ = 0 _s (initial time), the phase_ φ = φ0 _is called epoch (initial phase) where_ φ0 _is called the angle of epoch. Phase difference: Consider two particles_ executing simple harmonic motions. Their
equations are _y_1 = _A_ sin(ω_t_ + φ1) and _y2 = A sin(ωt + φ2), then the phase difference_ ∆φ= (ω_t_ + φ2) − (ω_t_ \+ φ1) = φ2 −φ1.

# ANGULAR SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION
## Time period and frequency of angular SHM
When a body is allowed to rotate freely about a given axis then the oscillation is known as the angular oscillation. The point  

at which the resultant torque acting on the body is taken to be zero is called mean position. If the body is displaced from the mean position, then the resultant torque acts such that it is proportional to the angular displacement and this torque has a tendency to bring the body towards the mean position. (Note: Torque is explained in unit 5) Let

Consider a system containing a block of mass _m_ attached to a massless spring with stiffness constant or force constant or spring constant _k_ placed on a smooth horizontal surface (frictionless surface) as shown in Figure 10.13. Let _x_0 be the equilibrium position or mean position of mass m when it is left undisturbed. Suppose the mass is displaced through a small displacement _x_ towards right from its equilibrium position and then released, it will oscillate back and forth about its mean position _x_0\. Let _F_ be the restoring force (due to stretching of the spring) which is proportional to the amount of displacement of block. For  

one dimensional motion, mathematically, we have

F ∝ _x_ F = − _k x_

where negative sign implies that the restoring force will always act opposite to the direction of the displacement. This equation is called Hooke’s law (refer to unit 7). Notice that, the restoring force is linear with the displacement (i.e., the exponent of force and displacement are unity). This is not always true; in case if we apply a very large stretching force, then the amplitude of oscillations becomes very large (which means, force is proportional to displacement containing higher powers of x) and therefore, the oscillation of the system is not linear and hence, it is called non-linear oscillation. We restrict ourselves only to linear oscillations throughout our discussions, which means Hooke’s law is valid (force and displacement have a linear relationship). From Newton’s second law, we can write the equation for the particle executing simple harmonic motion

_x_(_t_) = _A_ sin(ω_t_ +φ) (10.25)

Or

_x_(_t_) = _A_ cos(ω_t_ +φ) (10.26)

where _A_, ω and ϕ are constants. General solution for differential equation 10.21 is _x_(_t_) = _A_ sin(ω_t_ +φ)+ _B_ cos(ω_t_ +φ) where A and B are contants.

Let us consider a massless spring with stiffness constant or force constant k attached to a ceiling as shown in Figure 10.15. Let the length of the spring before loading mass _m_ be _L_. If the block of mass _m_ is attached to the other end of spring, then the spring elongates by a length _l_. Let F1 be the restoring force due to stretching of spring. Due to mass _m_, the gravitational force acts vertically downward. We can draw free-body diagram for this system as shown in Figure 10.15. When the system is under equilibrium,

F1 + mg = 0 (10.27)

But the spring elongates by small displacement _l_, therefore,

| l |
|------|------|------|------|
| m |y |
  

F1 ∝ _l_ ⇒ F1 = − _k l_ (10.28)

Substituting equation (10.28) in equation (10.27), we get

– _k l_ + _mg_ = 0 mg = kl

or

_m k_

_l g_

\= (10.29)

Suppose we apply a very small external force on the mass such that the mass further displaces downward by a displacement _y_, then it will oscillate up and down. Now, the restoring force due to this stretching of spring (total extension of spring is _y_ + _l_ ) is

F2 ∝ (_y_ + _l_) F2 = − _k_ (_y_ + _l_) = −_ky_−_kl_ (10.30)

Since, the mass moves up and down with acceleration _d y_

The net force acting on the mass due to this stretching is

_F_ = F2 +_mg_ _F_ _\=_ − _ky_−_kl_ +_mg_ (10.32)

The gravitational force opposes the restoring force. Substituting equation (10.29) in equation (10.32), we get

_F_ \= −_ky_ − _kl_ \+ _kl_ \= −_ky_

Applying Newton’s law, we get

## Combinations of springs
**Figure 10.16** Combination of spring as a shock-absorber in the motor cycle

Spring constant or force constant, also called as stiffness constant, is a measure of the stiffness of the spring.

Larger the value of the spring constant, stiffer is the spring. This implies that we need to apply more force to compress or elongate the spring. Similarly, smaller the value of spring constant, the spring can be stretched (elongated) or compressed with lesser force.

Springs can be connected in two ways. Either the springs can be connected end to end, also known as series connection, or alternatively, connected in parallel. In the following subsection, we compute the effective spring constant when

a. Springs are connected in series b. Springs are connected in parallel

a. **Springs connected in series** When two or more springs are connected in series, we can replace (by  

removing) all the springs in series with an equivalent spring (effective spring) whose net effect is the same as if all the springs are in series connection. Given the value of individual spring constants _k_1, _k_2, _k_3,... (known quantity), we can establish a mathematical relationship to find out an effective (or equivalent) spring constant _ks_ (unknown quantity). For simplicity, let us consider only two springs whose spring constant are _k_1 and _k_2 and which can be attached to a mass m as shown in Figure 10.17. The results thus obtained can be generalized for any number of springs in series.

**Figure 10.17** Springs are connected in series

_y_

Let _F_ be the applied force towards right as shown in Figure 10.18. Since the spring constants for different spring are different and the connection points between them is not rigidly fixed, the strings can stretch in different lengths. Let x1 and x2 be the elongation of springs from their equilibrium position (un-stretched position) due to the applied force F. Then, the net displacement of the mass point is

_x_ \= _x_1 + _x_2 (10.37)

From Hooke’s law, the net force
_F_ \= − _ks_ (_x_1 + _x_2) ⇒ _x_1 + _x_2 =− _F ks_

in series connection, the effective spring constant is lesser than the individual spring constants. From equation (10.39), we have,

Therefore, the effective spring constant is lesser than both _k_1 and _k_2.

b. **Springs connected in parallel** When two or more springs are connected in parallel, we can replace (by removing) all these springs with an equivalent spring (effective spring) whose net effect is same as if all the springs are in parallel connection. Given the values of individual spring constants to be _k_1,_k_2,_k_3, ... (known quantities), we can establish a mathematical relationship to find out an effective (or equivalent) spring constant _k_p (unknown quantity). For simplicity, let us consider only two springs of spring constants _k_1and _k_2 attached to a mass _m_ as shown in Figure 10.19. The results can be generalized to any number of springs in parallel.

Let the force _F_ be applied towards right as shown in Figure 10.20. In this case, both the springs elongate or compress by the same amount of displacement. Therefore, net force for the displacement of mass _m_ is

_F_ = −_k_p_x_ (10.45)

where kp is called effective spring constant. Let the first spring be elongated by a displacement _x_ due to force _F_1 and second spring be elongated by the same displacement _x_ due to force _F_2, then the net force

_F_ = − _k_1_x_ – _k_2_x_ (10.46)

Equating equations (10.46) and (10.45), we get

_k_p = _k_1 + _k_2 (10.47)

If all spring constants are identical i.e., _k_1 = _k_2= ... = _kn_ = _k_ then

_kp_ = _n_ _k_ (10.49)

This implies that the effective spring constant increases by a factor _n_. Hence, for the springs in parallel connection, the effective spring constant is greater than individual spring constant.

The spring constant is inversely proportional to the length of the spring

If the spring is cut into two pieces, one piece with length _l_1 and other with length _l_2, such that _l_1 = n_l_2, then spring constant of first length is

_k k n_1

1 =

second length is _k_2 = (_n_+1) _k_, where _k_ is the original spring constant before cutting into pieces.

**Note**

**EXAMPLE 10.10**

Consider two springs with force constants 1 N m−1 and 2 N m−1 connected in parallel. Calculate the effective spring constant (kp ) and comment on _kp_.

**_Solution_**

_k1_ = 1 N m−1, _k2_ = 2 N m−1

_kp_ = _k_1 + _k_2 N m−1

_kp_ = 1 + 2 = 3 N m−1

_kp_ > _k_1 and _kp_ > _k_2

Therefore, the effective spring constant is greater than both _k_1 and _k_2.

A pendulum is a mechanical system which exhibits periodic motion. It has a bob with mass m suspended by a long string (assumed to be massless and inextensible string) and the other end is fixed on a stand as shown in Figure 10.21 (a). At equilibrium, the pendulum does not oscillate and hangs vertically downward. Such a position is known as mean position or equilibrium position. When a pendulum is displaced through a small displacement from its equilibrium position and released, the bob of the pendulum executes to and fro motion. Let _l_ be the length of the pendulum which is taken as the distance between the point of suspension and the centre of gravity of the bob. Two forces act on the bob of the pendulum at any displaced position, as shown in the Figure 10.21 (d),

(i) The gravitational force acting on the body ( _F m g_

  = ) which acts vertically

downwards.

(ii) The tension in the string T 

which acts along the string to the point of suspension.

Resolving the gravitational force into its components:

a. Normal component: The component along the string but in opposition to the direction of tension, _Fas_ = _mg_ cosθ.

b. Tangential component: The component perpendicular to the string i.e., along tangential direction of arc of swing, _Fps_ = _mg_ sinθ.

Therefore, The normal component of the force is, along the string,

_T F m v las_− = 2

**Note**

From the Figure 10.21, we can observe that the tangential component _Wps_ of the gravitational force always points towards the equilibrium position i.e., the direction in which it always points opposite to the direction of displacement of the bob from the mean position. Hence, in this case, the tangential force is nothing but the restoring force. Applying Newton’s second law along tangential direction, we have

**(i) Law of length** For a given value of acceleration due

pendulum. This is similar to free fall. Therefore, in a pendulum of fixed length, it does not matter whether an elephant swings or an ant swings. Both of them will swing with the same time period.

**(ii) Amplitude of the oscillations** For a pendulum with small angle

approximation (angular displacement is very small), the time period is independent of amplitude of the oscillation.

Consider a U-shaped glass tube which consists of two open arms with uniform cross- sectional area A. Let us pour a non-viscous uniform incompressible liquid of density ρ in the U-shaped tube to a _h_eight _h_ as shown in the Figure 10.22. If the liquid and tube are not disturbed then the liquid surface will be in equilibrium position _O._ It means the pressure as measured at any point on the liquid is the same and also at the surface on the arm (edge of the tube on either side), which balances with the atmospheric pressure. Due to this the level of liquid in each arm will be the same. By blowing air one can provide sufficient force in one arm, and the liquid gets disturbed from equilibrium position _O_, which means, the pressure at blown arm is higher than the other arm. This creates difference in pressure which will cause the liquid to oscillate for a very short duration of time about the mean or equilibrium position and finally comes to rest.

Time period of the oscillation is

# ENERGY IN SIMPLE HARMONIC MOTION
**a. Expression for Potential Energy** For the simple harmonic motion, the force and the displacement are related by Hooke’s law

Since force is a vector quantity, in three dimensions it has three components. Further, the force in the above equation is a conservative force field; such a force can be derived from a scalar function which has only one component. In one dimensional case

_F_ = − _k x_ (10.63)

As we have discussed in unit 4 of volume I, the work done by the conservative force field is independent of path. The potential energy U can be calculated from the following expression.

_F dU dx_

Conservation of energy Both the kinetic energy and potential energy are

periodic functions, and repeat their

values after a time period . But total

energy is constant for all the values of x or t. The kinetic energy and the potential energy for a simple harmonic motion are always positive. Note that kinetic energy cannot take negative value because it is proportional to the square of velocity. The measurement of any physical quantity must be a real number. Therefore, if kinetic energy is negative then the numerical value of velocity becomes an imaginary number, which is physically not acceptable. At equilibrium, it is purely kinetic energy and at extreme positions it is purely potential energy.

**TYPES OF OSCILLATIONS:**

## Free oscillations
When the oscillator is allowed to oscillate by displacing its position from equilibrium position, it oscillates with a frequency which is equal to the natural frequency of the oscillator. Such an oscillation or vibration is known as free oscillation or free vibration. In this case, the amplitude, frequency and the energy of the vibrating object remains constant.

**Examples:** (i) Vibration of a tuning fork. (ii) Vibration in a stretched string. (iii) Oscillation of a simple pendulum. (iv) Oscillationsof a spring-mass system.

## Damped oscillations
During the oscillation of a simple pendulum (in previous case), we have assumed that the amplitude of the oscillation is constant and also the total energy of the oscillator is constant. But in reality, in a medium, due to the presence of friction and air drag, the amplitude of oscillation decreases as time progresses. It implies that the oscillation is not sustained and the energy of the SHM decreases gradually indicating the loss of energy. The energy lost is absorbed by the surrounding medium. This type of

| KE = 12U = |k(A x )2 –  2 KE12 kx U2 |Etotal =  2 |
|------|------|------|------|
  

oscillatory motion is known as damped oscillation. In other words, if an oscillator moves in a resistive medium, its amplitude goes on decreasing and the energy of the oscillator is used to do work against the resistive medium. The motion of the oscillator is said to be damped and in this case, the resistive force (or damping force) is proportional to the velocity of the oscillator.

**Examples** (i) The oscillations of a pendulum

(including air friction) or pendulum oscillating inside an oil filled container.

(ii) Electromagnetic oscillations in a tank circuit.

(iii) Oscillations in a dead beat and ballistic galvanometers.

## Maintained oscillations
While playing in swing, the oscillations will stop after a few cycles, this is due to damping. To avoid damping we have to supply a push to sustain oscillations. By supplying energy from an external source, the amplitude of the oscillation can be made constant. Such vibrations are known as maintained vibrations.  

**Example:** The vibration of a tuning fork getting energy from a battery or from external power supply.

## Forced oscillations
Any oscillator driven by an external periodic agency to overcome the damping is known as forced oscillator or driven oscillator. In this type of vibration, the body executing vibration initially vibrates with its natural frequency and due to the presence of external periodic force, the body later vibrates with the frequency of the applied periodic force. Such vibrations are known as forced vibrations.

**Example:** Sound boards of stringed instruments.

## Resonance
It is a special case of forced vibrations where the frequency of external periodic force (or driving force) matches with the natural frequency of the vibrating body (driven). As a result the oscillating body begins to vibrate such that its amplitude increases at each step and ultimately it has a large amplitude. Such a phenomenon is known as resonance and the corresponding vibrations are known as resonance vibrations.

**Example** The breaking of glass due to sound

The concept of resonance is used in Tuning of station (or channel) in a radio (or

Television) circuits.

**5\.** Show that for a particle executing simple harmonic motion

a. the average value of kinetic energy is equal to the average value of potential energy.

b. average potential energy = average

kinetic energy = 1 2

(total energy)

Hint : _average kinetic energy_ = <_kinetic_

_energy_\> = 1 0_T_

_Kineticenergy dt T_ ( )∫

and

_average Potential energy_ = <_Potential_

_energy_\> = 1 0_T_

_Potential energy dt T_ ( )∫
